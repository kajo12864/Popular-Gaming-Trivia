# Popular Gaming Trivia
### Description
Welcome to our gaming trivia GitHub page! Though I (K.J.) have previously used GitHub to view repositories, I have never created one of my own (manually) until this project called for it. I hope that this is satisfactory.

Onto the project itself, it is a basic command-line-based quiz program that is functionally split into three "screens" on the user end: the Quiz Menu in which the player selects which quiz they desire and input how many questions they want to be asked, the Quiz Gameplay segment which generates questions and collects user score, and the Quiz Results which prints the score and asks whether the player would like to take another quiz. Near the end of the semester, we had begun making programs that are more compartmentalized - meaning, they may have multiple functionalities or "screens" in which different types of input or output are given. The best example would be Assignment 4's Bank program, in which students were expected to make a program that can do a variety of processes depending on what a user selects (printing an amortization schedule, making a payment, displaying a pay-off time report, etc.). Though it was not explicitely stated in the assignment instructions, this type of program called for a nonlinear approach, such as having the user choose from a variety of items from a menu in any order. Similarly, the gaming trivia program also begins with a menu, allowing the user to choose any quiz in whichever order they please. Since many programs with real-world applications tend to have a variety of ways a user can interact with them, I feel as though non-linear menu-based programs will be requested more often in higher-level programming courses, and that it was best to go for this approach for our own project.

The code itself may be explained as three sections as well: File Declarations & Definitions, the main While Loop, and the Inner For Loop. As the program is a trivia quiz, the bulk of the program is made up of question objects. There are 10 questions for each of the four standard quizzes (based off of Minecraft, Terraria, Pokemon Scarlet & Violet, and Super Mario 64), making 40 questions in total. Each question object is made up of a prompt string (the question itself), an answer choices string (where each question is multiple choice and must be answered A, B, C, or D), and a correct answer char (which matches the correct answer choice's character). Beyond defining questions, however, there is also the random device and default random engine (used to create a random seed for each run of the program) used to randomize the order of questions, error handling functions (for both entering incorrect input types and numbers out of the range of given numerical options) and values defined to hold user input.

The While Loop of the function includes everything that may be repeated on each run, specifically when the user decides they want to take another quiz. It begins by listing each quiz and prompting the player to enter a number corrosponding to which quiz they want to take. The first four options are all standard quizzes of each of the four games that can give up to 10 questions, while the fifth option is a "Quiz Mash-up" that has up to 40 questions, as it may include questions from every game's trivia. Once the player chooses an option, the program checks if the input was valid (if the input cannot be an integer, is less than 1, or is greater than 5, it is considered invalid and the user must enter a valid integer) and then enters a switch case statement. The statement checks what number the player entered, populates a question bank vector accordingly, and proceeds to enter the Inner For Loop.
